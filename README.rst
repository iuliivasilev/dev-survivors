**Survivors** is a Python library for survival analysis designed to handle real-world, messy, and heterogeneous data with high accuracy and interpretability.

Unlike many existing libraries that rely on strong theoretical assumptions (e.g., proportional hazards, exponential distributions), **Survivors** is:

* **Flexible**: works with incomplete, noisy, and heterogeneous tabular data.
* **Interpretable**: powered by survival trees and ensembles (forests) that offer transparent decision paths.
* **Highly sensitive to data structure**: tree splits are adapted to handle informative censoring and arbitrary time-to-event distributions.
* **Accurate**: avoids restrictive model assumptions, resulting in higher predictive performance in complex settings.

Key Features
------------

Survivors was developed during a PhD project at Lomonosov Moscow State University to overcome the limitations of traditional survival analysis.
It is designed to handle data with informative censoring and arbitrary time-to-event distributions. Here's what makes it stand out:

* **Data Included** – Comes with 18+ real-world `datasets <https://iuliivasilev.github.io/dev-survivors/modules/Datasets.html>`_ from healthcare, CRM, and more.
* **True Continuous-Time Modeling** – No discretization needed; time is continuous where it matters: at prediction.
* **Custom Metrics That Matter** – Over 10 evaluation metrics crafted to handle censoring, imbalance, and rare events.
* **Speed Meets Scale** – Optimized from scratch with JIT compilation, vectorized math, and histogram-based splits for efficient performance.
* **Experiment-Ready** – Built-in module for reproducible experiments: hold-out, cross-validation, time-aware splits, and hyperparameter search.
* **Meta-Modeling Power** – Create stratified models and ensemble aggregators with ease.
* **Broad Applicability** – Suitable for a wide range of domains including healthcare (death or discharge prediction), industrial maintenance (equipment failure), and business analytics (customer churn and retention).

Getting Started
---------------

The `user guides <https://iuliivasilev.github.io/dev-survivors/auto_examples/plot_user_guide.html>`_ provide detailed information on the key concepts for **survivors**::

    import survivors.datasets as ds
    import survivors.constants as cnt
    from survivors.tree import CRAID

    X, y, features, categ, sch_nan = ds.load_gbsg_dataset()

    cr = CRAID(criterion='wilcoxon', depth=2, min_samples_leaf=0.1, 
            signif=0.05, categ=categ, leaf_model="base")
    cr.fit(X, y)
    tree_view = cr.visualize(mode="surv")
    tree_view
